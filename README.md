# UselessBox

Box that automatically turns itself off after turning on.
Kit from ThinkGeek: http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ef0b/

Involves screwing together box and soldering circuit together

Logic: 

When the switch is flicked on, the arm spins counterclockwise, eventually tapping the switch to the off position. This causes the arm to spin clockwise, until it rests on a limit switch at the floor of the box, opening the circuit.
